# Identifying-Customer-Segments for Avarto

This project uses Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques including Dimensionality Reduction and K-means Clustering to identify potential customers
for Avarto. First, Demographic data is used to identify clusters using K-means. These clusters are then compared with existing customers 
to identify the group of people that could be potential new customers to the company. 

## Data
As part of the agreement with Avarto, the data could not be provided publicly here. 

## Code
The IPython Notebook with the code and visualizations can be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dhavalpotdar/Identifying-Customer-Segments/blob/master/Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb).
